Name: Cell Painting Image Collection
Description: 
  The Cell Painting Image Collection is a collection of freely 
  downloadable microscopy image sets. Cell Painting is an 
  unbiased high throughput imaging assay used to analyze 
  perturbations in cell models. In addition to the images 
  themselves, each set includes a description of the biological 
  application and some type of "ground truth" (expected results). 
  Researchers are encouraged to use these image sets as reference 
  points when developing, testing, and publishing new image 
  analysis algorithms for the life sciences. We hope that the 
  this data set will lead to a better understanding of which 
  methods are best for various biological image analysis 
  applications.
