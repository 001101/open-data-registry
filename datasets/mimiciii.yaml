Description: |
  MIMIC-III (‘Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care’) is a large, 
  single-center database comprising information relating to patients 
  admitted to critical care units at a large tertiary care hospital. 
  Data includes vital signs, medications, laboratory measurements, 
  observations and notes charted by care providers, fluid balance, 
  procedure codes, diagnostic codes, imaging reports, hospital length 
  of stay, survival data, and more. The database supports applications 
  including academic and industrial research, quality improvement initiatives, 
  and higher education coursework. The MIMIC-III dataset is freely-available. 
  Researchers seeking to use the database must formally request access. For details, see
